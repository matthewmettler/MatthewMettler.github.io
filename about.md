I am a scholar of American political behavior whose research explores how citizens navigate information environments, form political judgments, and fulfill their democratic roles. My dissertation examines how partisan identity, cognitive resources, and media cues shape perceptions of fact and opinion, offering insights into the erosion of shared empirical foundations in civil discourse. Beyond my dissertation, my research agenda spans several projects on misinformation, including work on conceptualizing and measuring the multidimensional structure of political information and misinformation, linguistic markers of political falsehoods as interventions to combat misinformation, political memory biases, and economic recollections and perceptions during election cycles. I have co-authored a book manuscript that provides a systematic account of how citizens justify their own policy preferences and whether they can articulate the best arguments for the opposing side, offering a novel perspective on the quality of democratic reasoning. My broader work investigates democratic backsliding, religious influences on political judgment, and individual perceptions of institutions, with particular attention to how experiences spill over across institutional domains and how institutional reforms shape symbolic and substantive representation. My research has been published in Misinformation Review, Politics & Religion, and Social Science Quarterly.

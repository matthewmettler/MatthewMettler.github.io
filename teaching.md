Iâ€™ve taught **Introduction to Politics** and **Introduction to American Politics** at UIUC and designed **Media & Politics** modules on Lippmann, Marcuse, indexing vs. cascading activation, and platform governance.

Selected materials:
- Syllabi (on request)
- Lecture outlines and activities (Lippmann, Marcuse, media models)
